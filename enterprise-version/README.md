- Comprehensive security and encryption
- Regulatory compliance framework
- Risk management systems
- Multi-phase development plan
- Production deployment considerations

## If You Want to Resume Enterprise Development

1. Move files back to root directory
2. Follow the 6-phase development plan in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
3. Use the fintech agent specifications for implementation
4. Start with Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Foundation

The enterprise version was designed to meet financial industry standards and regulatory requirements, but requires significantly more development time and complexity.
