## üîç Attribution Analysis: Asset Selection vs Strategy Performance

### **What Changes After Optimization?**

- **Asset selection still matters most:** The risk-managed BUY_HOLD baseline averaged **414%** with the same asset universe, proving that underlying secular trends are the foundation of performance.
- **Optimized timing adds real alpha:** SMA (1,482% avg), EMA (1,381% avg), and MACD (1,002% avg) now beat BUY_HOLD on average by **+1,068%, +967%, and +588%** respectively. Parameter tuning lets momentum strategies stay in parabolic crypto runs much longer than the default settings allowed.
- **Risk safeguards remain decisive:** Even with aggressive parameters, **0/40 assets closed negative** once stop losses, position sizing, and drawdown guards were applied.

### **Strategy Value Proposition**
| Component | Optimized Insight | Evidence |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Risk Management** | üî• **NON-NEGOTIABLE** | No strategy breached risk caps; every asset stayed positive after optimization |
| **Parameter Optimization** | ‚úÖ **ALPHA DRIVER** | SMA/EMA/MACD outperformed BUY_HOLD by 500-1,000% on average with tuned inputs |
| **Drawdown Control** | ‚úÖ **PROVEN** | Stop losses and heat limits enabled momentum strategies to survive pullbacks |
| **Behavioral Discipline** | ‚úÖ **ESSENTIAL** | Systematic execution ensured we captured crypto manias without oversized leverage |
| **Strategy Diversification** | üü° **MIXED** | Bollinger and RSI improve stability, while Momentum still lags despite tuning |

### **Honest Performance Assessment**
- **SMA & EMA**: Big winners once the optimizer stretched long-period pairs for crypto breakouts.
- **MACD**: Delivers balanced alpha, especially on XRP, XLM, and ETC with short signal windows.
- **BUY_HOLD**: Remains the safest baseline and still tops 13 assets, especially large-cap equities.
- **BOLLINGER & RSI**: Provide reliable, lower-volatility alternatives with 95%+ win ratios.
- **MOMENTUM**: Underperforms even after tuning‚Äîits zero-threshold exits miss sustained trends.

|------|----------|------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| ü•á **1st** | **SMA** | **1,482%** | **90%** | 36/40 | Wide crossover windows ride parabolic crypto breakouts |
| ü•à **2nd** | **EMA** | **1,381%** | **90%** | 36/40 | Faster exponential crossovers capture mid-cycle surges |
| ü•â **3rd** | **MACD** | **1,002%** | **85%** | 34/40 | Compressed signal periods excel on XRP, XLM, ETC |
| 4th | **BUY_HOLD** | **414%** | **67.5%** | 27/40 | Simplest baseline for mega-cap tech and resilient crypto |
| 5th | **BOLLINGER** | **150%** | **97.5%** | 39/40 | Low-volatility mean reversion with tight risk clamps |

- **MACD** thrives with aggressive 12/21/6 and 8/21/6 parameter sets, especially on high-beta crypto.
- **BOLLINGER** quietly posts the highest win rate; it sidesteps blow-ups even when returns lag.
- **RSI** becomes a tactical tool with 10-period/20-70 bands, prioritising capital preservation.
- **MOMENTUM** needs a new exit heuristic‚Äîthe optimizer confirmed the current design rarely beats BUY_HOLD.

## üéØ Key Insights & Investment Recommendations

### **Strategic Findings**
1. **SMA & EMA Momentum**: Optimized crossover pairs (short 5-20 vs long 50-100) now deliver the highest compounded returns.

- **Momentum Sleeve (30%)**: Optimized SMA/EMA allocations on breakout-prone crypto baskets.
- **Defensive Overlay (20%)**: BOLLINGER or RSI on stocks/ETFs to dampen volatility and capture disciplined pullbacks.

**Risk Management Priorities:**
- Maintain 2% maximum risk per trade across all strategies
- Implement portfolio heat monitoring at 8-10% maximum
- Use fractional position sizing for expensive assets
- Regular rebalancing based on performance metrics
